Key Improvements

    Clear Register Access Rules:
        Access to REG_ADDR_A and REG_ADDR_B follows specified rules (e.g., read-before-write for A and clear-before-write for B).

    Type Safety and Volatile Usage:
        Registers are accessed through volatile uint8_t * to prevent compiler optimizations and ensure correct memory-mapped IO behavior.

    Improved Readability:
        Bit masks are clearly defined, making the purpose of operations obvious.

    Encapsulation of Rules:
        Helper functions encapsulate specific register access rules, reducing redundancy and the likelihood of errors.

    Atomicity Preparation:
        Atomic access can be ensured in future by wrapping critical sections with interrupt disabling/enabling if required.

By implementing these changes, the code becomes safer, more robust, and easier to understand and maintain.
